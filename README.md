# UX Portfolio

About me...

My name is Tanner Hart and my title is Web Developer

I am taking usability with the intent to improve my UX analysis to apply to my day job where I implement UI's for clients. I took Software Engineering previously and enjoyed building the app my team voted for. 

I work as a full time web developer alongside attending school. It is difficult but rewarding and I expect this course to add to my knowledge base.
